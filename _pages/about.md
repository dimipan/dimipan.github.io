Prior to joining [DARTeC](https://www.cranfield.ac.uk/centres/digital-aviation-research-and-technology-centre), I received my Diploma from the University of West Attica and worked both as an **undergraduate intern** and **Research Associate** in the [Extreme Robotics Laboratory (ERL)](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/activity/metallurgy-materials/robotics/index.aspx) at the [University of Birmingham](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/index.aspx) under the supervision of [Dr Manolis Chiou](http://manolischiou.com/). The research aimed to suggest probabilistic solutions to **variable autonomy** robotic systems with a **human-in-the-loop** deployed in hazardous or remote environments, by building robots that can perceive the status of human operators. -->

Prior to joining [DARTeC](https://www.cranfield.ac.uk/centres/digital-aviation-research-and-technology-centre), I received my Diploma from the University of West Attica and worked as both an **undergraduate intern** and a **Research Associate** in the [Extreme Robotics Laboratory (ERL)](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/activity/metallurgy-materials/robotics/index.aspx) at the [University of Birmingham](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/index.aspx) under the supervision of [Dr. Manolis Chiou](http://manolischiou.com/). My research aimed to propose probabilistic solutions for **variable autonomy** robotic systems with a **human-in-the-loop**, deployed in hazardous or remote environments, by building robots that can perceive the status of human operators.

My current interests broadly encompass the application of **advanced computational tools** to enhance **autonomous systems**. Specifically, my work focuses on integrating **large language models (LLMs)** with **hierarchical learning techniques** to improve decision-making in **complex environments**, such as **search and rescue (SAR) operations**. By leveraging **natural language inputs** from human stakeholders, I aim to make autonomous systems more **adaptive** and **context-aware**, facilitating more efficient **information gathering** and **task execution**. The general impact of this work lies in bridging the gap between **human intelligence** and **machine capabilities**, ultimately advancing the field of **autonomous robotics** and improving responses in **high-stakes, dynamic scenarios**.
