I am a PhD Student in the [Digital Aviation Research and Technology Centre (DARTeC)](https://www.cranfield.ac.uk/centres/digital-aviation-research-and-technology-centre) at [Cranfield University](https://www.cranfield.ac.uk/) specializing in **human-robot teaming** with a keen interest in using **machine learning** algorithms contributing to scientific research endeavours under the supervision of [Prof. Weisi Guo](https://www.weisiguo.com). My pronouns are he/him/his.

My current research is, mainly, focused on developing and applying human-robot teaming techniques to allow human and drones to work alongside each other to rapidly improve **search and rescue** operations in natural and man-made disaster environments. The interest lies in demonstrating the integration of **human knowledge** with **learning** methods in autonomous systems while performing in dynamic environments. My vision is to advance fundamental understanding of intelligent agentsâ€™ **decision-making** in human(s)-robot(s), robot(s)-robot(s) cooperation/collaboration/coordination drawing from a range of different disciplines such as Bayesian inference, game theory, reinforcement learning, and cognitive science.

Prior to joining [DARTeC](https://www.cranfield.ac.uk/centres/digital-aviation-research-and-technology-centre), I worked both as an **intern** and **Research Associate** in the [Extreme Robotics Laboratory (ERL)](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/activity/metallurgy-materials/robotics/index.aspx) at the [University of Birmingham](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/index.aspx) under the supervision of [Dr Manolis Chiou](http://manolischiou.com/). The research aimed to suggest solutions to **variable autonomy** robotic systems with a **human-in-the-loop** deployed in hazardous or remote environments, by building robots that can be remotely controlled and quickly perceive the status of human operators.

Outside of univeristy, I have also been a **private tutor** teaching primary and secondary school students Maths, Geometry, and Physics. My other passions include health and fitness, tennis, philosophy, music, and being intellectual curious.
