I am a PhD Student in the [Digital Aviation Research and Technology Centre (DARTeC)](https://www.cranfield.ac.uk/centres/digital-aviation-research-and-technology-centre) at [Cranfield University](https://www.cranfield.ac.uk/) specializing in **human-robot teaming** with a keen interest in using **machine learning** methods to contribute to scientific research endeavours under the supervision of Professor [Weisi Guo](https://www.weisiguo.com). My pronouns are he/him/his.

My current research is, mainly, focused on developing and applying human-robot teaming techniques to allow human and drones to work alongside each other to rapidly improve **search and rescue** operations in natural and man-made disaster environments. The interest lies in demonstrating the integration of **human knowledge** with learning methods in autonomous systems while performing in dynamic environments. My vision is to advance fundamental understanding of intelligent agents’ **decision-making** in human(s)-robot(s), robot(s)-robot(s) cooperation/collaboration/coordination drawing from a range of different disciplines such as Bayesian inference, game theory, reinforcement learning, and cognitive science.

Outside of univeristy, I have also been a **private tutor** teaching primary and secondary school students Maths, Geometry, and Physics. My other passions include health and fitness, tennis, philosophy, and being intellectual curious.
