I am a PhD Student in the [Digital Aviation Research and Technology Centre (DARTeC)](https://www.cranfield.ac.uk/centres/digital-aviation-research-and-technology-centre) at [Cranfield University](https://www.cranfield.ac.uk/) specializing in **human-robot teaming** with a keen interest in using **machine learning** methods to contribute to scientic endeavors. Under the supervision of Professor [Weisi Guo](https://www.weisiguo.com/), my research is, mainly, focused on developing and applying human-robot teaming techniques to allow human and drones to work alongside each other to rapidly improve **search and rescue** operations in natural and man-made disaster environments. The vision is to demonstrate the integration of human knowledge with learning methods in autonomous systems in dynamic environments.
