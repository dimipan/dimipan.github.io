I am a Ph.D. Student in the [Digital Aviation Research and Technology Centre (DARTeC)](https://www.cranfield.ac.uk/centres/digital-aviation-research-and-technology-centre) at [Cranfield University](https://www.cranfield.ac.uk/) specializing in **human-drone teaming** under the supervision of [Prof. Weisi Guo](https://www.weisiguo.com). My pronouns are he/him/his.

Prior to joining [DARTeC](https://www.cranfield.ac.uk/centres/digital-aviation-research-and-technology-centre), I received my Diploma from the University of West Attica and worked both as an **undergraduate intern** and **Research Associate** in the [Extreme Robotics Laboratory (ERL)](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/activity/metallurgy-materials/robotics/index.aspx) at the [University of Birmingham](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/index.aspx) under the supervision of [Dr Manolis Chiou](http://manolischiou.com/). The research aimed to suggest probabilistic solutions to **variable autonomy** robotic systems with a **human-in-the-loop** deployed in hazardous or remote environments, by building robots that can perceive the status of human operators.

My current research involves exploring and developing **RL algorithms** and **human feedback** integration methods to allow human and drones to work alongside each other to improve **search and rescue** operations in natural and/or man-made disaster environments. In particular, I am interested in enabling AI agents to learn complex tasks and environments through human feedback ensuring that they behave in a way that would align with human values and preferences. My vision is to advance fundamental understanding of intelligent agentsâ€™ **decision-making** in human(s)-robot(s), robot(s)-robot(s) cooperation/collaboration/coordination drawing from a range of different disciplines such as Bayesian inference, game theory, reinforcement learning, and cognitive science.
