I am a **Ph.D. student** at the [Digital Aviation Research and Technology Centre (DARTeC)](https://www.cranfield.ac.uk/centres/digital-aviation-research-and-technology-centre) at [Cranfield University](https://www.cranfield.ac.uk/), affiliated with the [School of Aerospace, Transport, and Manufacturing (SATM)](https://www.cranfield.ac.uk/themes/aerospace). I specialise in **_human-machine teaming_** under the supervision of [Prof. Weisi Guo](https://www.weisiguo.com).

Prior to joining [DARTeC](https://www.cranfield.ac.uk/centres/digital-aviation-research-and-technology-centre), I received my Diploma from the University of West Attica and worked as both an **undergraduate intern** and a **Research Associate** in the [Extreme Robotics Laboratory (ERL)](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/activity/metallurgy-materials/robotics/index.aspx) at the [University of Birmingham](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/index.aspx) under the supervision of [Dr. Manolis Chiou](http://manolischiou.com/). My research aimed to propose probabilistic solutions for **variable autonomy** robotic systems with a **human-in-the-loop**, deployed in hazardous or remote environments, by building robots that can perceive the status of human operators.

My current interests broadly encompass the application of advanced computational tools to enhance **autonomous systems**. Specifically, my work focuses on integrating **large language models (LLMs)** with **hierarchical learning** techniques to improve decision-making in complex environments, such as **search and rescue (SAR)** operations. By leveraging **natural language** inputs from human stakeholders, I aim to make autonomous systems more adaptive and **context-aware**, facilitating more efficient information gathering and task execution. The general impact of this work lies in bridging the gap between **human** and **machine** intelligence, ultimately advancing the field of autonomous robotics and improving responses in **high-stakes**, dynamic scenarios.
